# Java-Linear-Regression

This application was developed by two students(me && Antonio Cacio) as part of the Computer Algorithms and Modeling
course at University of Greenwich.

As stated above keep in mind that the code was written by students who were learning to do so and as such the quality of the code
or the methods used might not be "Excellent".


The context of the project was to develop a Java application that would use linear regression in order to predict the price of houses in the future. The application is given a dataset in the form of a text file. 

The information are displayed with the use of graphs.
